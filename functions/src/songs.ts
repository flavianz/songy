        lyrics: "Just gonna stand there and watch me burn\r\nWell, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts\r\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\r\nWell, that's all right, because I love the way you lie\r\nI love the way you lie\n\nI can't tell you what it really is\n\nI can only tell you what it feels like\n\nAnd right now there's a steel knife in my windpipe\n\nI can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight\n\nAs long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight\n\nHigh off her love, drunk from her hate\n\nIt's like I'm huffing paint and I love her the more I suffer\n\nI suffocate and right before I'm about to drown\n\nShe resuscitates me, she fucking hates me, and I love it\n\nWait, where you going?, I'm leaving you\n\nNo, you ain't, come back!\n\nWe're running right back, here we go again\n\nIt's so insane, 'cause when it's going good, it's going great\n\nI'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane\n\nBut when it's bad it's awful, I feel so ashamed\n\nI snap, Who's that dude?, I don't even know his name\n\nI laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again\n\nI guess I don't know my own strength\n\n\n\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn\n\nWell, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts\n\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\n\nWell, that's all right, because I love the way you lie\n\nI love the way you lie, I love the way you lie\n\n\n\nYou ever love somebody so much\n\nYou can barely breathe when you're with them?\n\nYou meet, and neither one of you even know what hit them\n\nGot that warm fuzzy feeling\n\nYeah, them chills used to get them\n\nNow you're getting fucking sick of looking at them?\n\nYou swore you'd never hit them, never do nothing to hurt them\n\nNow you're in each other's face\n\nSpewing venom in your words when you spit them\n\nYou push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit them\n\nThrow them down, pin them\n\nSo lost in the moments when you're in 'em\n\nIt's the rage that took over, it controls you both\n\nSo they say it's best to go your separate ways\n\nGuess that they don't know you\n\n'Cause today, that was yesterday\n\nYesterday is over, it's a different day\n\nSound like broken records playing over\n\nBut you promised her next time you'd show restraint\n\nYou don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game\n\nBut you lied again\n\nNow you get to watch her leave out the window\n\nGuess that's why they call it window pane\n\n\n\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn\n\nWell, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts\n\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\n\nWell, that's all right, because I love the way you lie\n\nI love the way you lie, I love the way you lie\n\n\n\nNow, I know we said things, did things, that we didn't mean\n\nAnd we fall back into the same patterns, same routines\n\nBut your temper's just as bad as mine is\n\nYou're the same as me\n\nWhen it comes to love, you're just as blinded\n\nBaby, please come back, it wasn't you, baby it was me\n\nMaybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems\n\nMaybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano\n\nAll I know is I love you too much to walk away though\n\nCome inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk\n\nDon't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?\n\nTold you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball\n\nNext time I'm pissed I'll aim my fist at the drywall\n\nNext time? There won't be no next time\n\nI apologize even though I know it's lies\n\nI'm tired of the games, I just want her back\n\nI know I'm a liar, if she ever tries to fucking leave again\n\nI'ma tie her to the bed and set this house on fire\n\n\n\nJust gonna stand there and watch me burn\n\nWell, that's all right, because I like the way it hurts\n\nJust gonna stand there and hear me cry\n\nWell, that's all right, because I love the way you lie\n\nI love the way you lie, I love the way you lie",

party\r\nA cross between a zombie apocalypse and big Bobby \"The\n\nBrain\" Heenan which is probably the\n\nSame reason I wrestle with mania\n\nShady's in this bitch, I'm posse'd up\n\nConsider it to cross me a costly mistake\n\nIf they sleepin' on me, the hoes better get insomnia\n\nADHD, hydroxycut\n\nPass the Courvoisi' (Hey, hey)\n\nIn AA with an AK, melee, finna set it like a playdate\n\nBetter vacate, retreat like a vacay, mayday\n\nThis beat is cray-cray, Ray J, H-A-H-A-H-A\n\nLaughing all the way to the bank, I spray flings\n\nThey cannot tame or placate the (Ayy)\n\n\n\nMonster\n\nYou get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)\n\nI'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)\n\nWhen the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers\n\nI look like a villain outta those blockbusters\n\nGodzilla, fire spitter, monster\n\nBlood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet\n\nFire, Godzilla, fire, monster\n\nBlood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet\n\n\n\nI'm just a product of Slick Rick, at Onyx, told 'em lick the balls\n\nHad 'em just appalled at so many things that pissed 'em off\n\nIt's impossible to list 'em all\n\nAnd in the midst of all this\n\nI'm in a mental hospital with a crystal ball\n\nTryna see, will I still be like this tomorrow?\n\nRisperdal, voices whisper\n\nMy fist is balled back up against the wall, pencil drawn\n\nThis is just the song to go ballistic on\n\nYou just pulled a pistol on the guy with the missile launcher\n\nI'm just a Loch Ness, the mythological\n\nQuick to tell a bitch go off like a fifth of Vodka\n\nWhen you twist the top of the bottle, I'm a\n\n\n\nMonster\n\nYou get in my way, I'ma feed you to the monster (Yeah)\n\nI'm normal during the day, but at night, turn to a monster (Yeah)\n\nWhen the moon shines like Ice Road Truckers\n\nI look like a villain outta those blockbusters\n\nGodzilla, fire spitter, monster\n\nBlood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet\n\nFire, Godzilla, fire, monster\n\nBlood on the dance floor, and on the Louis V carpet\n\n\n\nIf you never gave a damn, raise your hand\n\n'Cause I'm about to set trip, vacation plans\n\nI'm on point like my index is, so all you will ever get is\n\nThe motherfuckin' finger (Finger), prostate exam ('Xam)\n\nHow can I have all these fans and perspire?\n\nLike a liar's pants, I'm on fire\n\nAnd I got no plans to retire and I'm still the man you admire\n\nThese chicks are spazzin' out, I only get more handsome and flier\n\nI got 'em passin' out like what you do when you hand someone flyers\n\nAnd what goes around comes around just like the blades on a chainsaw\n\n'Cause I caught the flap of my dollar stack right off the bat like a baseball\n\nLike Kid Ink, bitch, I got them racks with so much ease that they call me Diddy\n\n'Cause I make bands and I call getting cheese a cakewalk (Cheesecake, yeah)\n\nBitch, I'm a player, I'm too motherfuckin' stingy for Cher\n\nWon't even lend you an ear, ain't even pretending to care\n\nBut I tell a bitch I'll marry her if she'll bury her\n\nFace on my genital area, the original Richard Ramirez\n\nChristian Rivera, 'cause my lyrics never sit well\n\nSo they wanna give me the chair\n\nLike a paraplegic, and it's scary, call it Harry Caray\n\n'Cause every time a Dick and Harry carry and marry a motherfuckin' dictionary\n\nGot 'em swearing up and down, they can't spit, this shit's hilarious\n\nIt's time to put these bitches in the obituary column\n\nWe wouldn't see eye to eye with a staring problem\n\nGet the shaft like a staring column (Mark Jack)\n\nTrigger happy, pack heat, but it's black ink\n\nGive 'em half of the bad beats\n\nEvil, that means take a back seat\n\nTake it back to Fat Petes with a maxi, single\n\nLook at my rap sheets, what attracts these people\n\nIs my gangster, bitch, like Apache with a catchy jingle\n\nI stack chips, you barely got a half-eaten Cheeto\n\nFill 'em with the venom and eliminate 'em\n\nOther words, I Minute Maid 'em\n\nI don't want to hurt 'em, but I did 'em in a fit of rage\n\nI'm murderin' again, nobody will evade him\n\nFinna kill 'em and dump all the fuckin' bodies in the lake\n\nObliterating everything, incinerate and renegade 'em\n\nAnd I make anybody who want it with the pen afraid\n\nAnd don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway\n\n'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill\n\nAnd I tell 'em kill or be killed, I'm a killer, be the vanilla gorilla\n\nYou're bringin' the killer within me out of me\n\nYou don't want to be the enemy of the demon who went in me\n\nOr be recievin' enemy, what stupidity it'd be\n\nEvery bit of me is the epitome of a spitter\n\nWhen I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck\n\nOr you finna be dead the minute you run into me\n\nA hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me\n\nI'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you bitch, I'm unfadable\n\nYou wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable\n\nI'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable\n\nI'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full\n\nI'm not afraid to pull the\n\n\n\nMan, stop\n\nLook what I'm plannin', haha",
